/**
 * This class embodies a document link; it is what is retrieved from the API when
 * a link is created towards another document in the repository.
 * Do note that in those cases, you do not retrieve all of the linked documents,
 * but only enough information to build your link to the document. For this reason,
 * this is also the class of the object passed in the linkResolver function.
 * LinkInterface objects can be found in two occasions: as the "$link" variable of a HyperlinkSpan object
 * (which happens when the link is a hyperlink in a StructuredText fragment), or the LinkInterface
 * can also be its own fragment (e.g. for a "related" fragment, that links to a related document).
